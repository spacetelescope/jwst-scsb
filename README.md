## Set your Environment to access the example datasets
Many of the notebooks use example data, this data will be saved to a common location on central store, where it can be copied from or directly accessed. Before running a notebook, make sure to set the following environment variable to the location of the data you are using: `export JWST_NOTEBOOK_DATA=/path/to/the/data`
