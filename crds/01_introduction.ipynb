    "## What's a CRDS?\n",
    "\n",
    "CRDS is a repository for reference files and a service that identifies the \"best\" reference files for a given dataset.  The acronym CRDS stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calibration**: The data managed by CRDS (with a notable exception) are used with calibration software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference**: \"Reference\" data contrasts with the input dataset being calibrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**: CRDS manages data in the form of files, both reference data files and CRDS's own configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System**: CRDS is more than just a directory of files.  Its responsibilities require a client/server architecture, client-side caching, dynamic configuration, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRDS is generally pronounced \"see-are-dee-ess\" but I dare you to start referring to it as \"curds\"."

    "## Great, so what's a reference file?\n",
    "\n",
    "A reference file is any data besides the input dataset that the calibration pipeline needs in order to get its job done.  Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measurements of instrument characteristics needed to make a flat-field correction to a dataset.\n",
    "- A set of default values for calibration pipeline parameters.\n",
    "- Visit the [JWST CRDS website](https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/) and expand the accordion buttons under \"Operational References\" to see many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRDS supports the following reference file formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ASDF (http://asdf-format.org)\n",
    "- FITS (https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov)\n",
    "- JSON (https://www.json.org)\n",

    "## Why do we need a system to manage them?\n",
    "\n",
    "One could imagine a simple arrangement of storing reference files on a shared filesystem in some well-defined directory structure.  What's wrong with that?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disciplined version control\n",
    "\n",
    "For one thing, the reference files need to be strictly versioned.  Calibration software users need to be able to rely on consistent results, and if reference files are being updated in-place, they may see confusing differences from one run to the next.  Older versions of files need to be kept around, so that changes may be reverted in the event of a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRDS enforces versioning -- once a file has been accepted into the system, it cannot be modified in-place.  Any update must be submitted as a new file, which is identified as superseding the old file but does not overwrite it.  This allows users to view the full history of changes to the file, and \"rewind\" back to an older version if necessary.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another of CRDS's important functions is to check incoming reference files for correctness.  Each reference file type has a set of validations that are defined in the CRDS codebase, and CRDS will validate proposed updates to files and warn or reject them outright when the file content appears invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation of changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The CRDS web submission form requires that any changes to CRDS content be accompanied by extensive documentation, and will refuse to accept files when information is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public access\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference files need to be available to the wider community, which would not have access to an STScI shared filesystem.  The (ops) CRDS servers are open to the public and anyone can visit the website or install the client library and obtain reference files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration vs. code\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, selecting the best reference file involves a navigating a complex set of rules that is unique to each reference file type.  Implementing these rules in the pipeline code isn't feasible, because reference files are updated far more regularly than software is released.  CRDS solves this problem by treating the rules themselves as data, versioning them alongside the reference files and allowing them to be dynamically configured via the CRDS website.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user requests the \"best\" reference file from CRDS, it consults the rules for the requested reference file type and returns the file that best suits the user's data.  We will spend the remainder of the notebook exploring this reference file selection function, which is mainly what CRDS end users are interested in."

    "When we called the `crds.getreferences` client library method, the client code made an API request to the CRDS server with the parameters that we supplied.  The server determined the best reference file based on the rules in our chosen context and returned that information to the client in the form of a filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the client checked its local on-disk cache for the presence of that file.  When the file was discovered to be missing, the client made an additional request to the CRDS server to fetch the file content.  The server read the content from its own storage area and transmitted the bytes over HTTP back to the client.  The client then created the file in its local cache and returned to us a filesystem path to that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to make another call to `crds.getreferences` with the same parameters, the client would still make that initial API request, but because the file had previously been cached, it would not need to download the reference file content again.\n",

    "### Visiting the CRDS website\n",
    "\n",
    "When we followed a link to a rules file page, the page was served up by that same CRDS server.  The server read the rules file content from its storage area and transformed it into a convenient web format.  In addition to conveniences like browsing files, the CRDS website also provides the main method of submitting new reference files and rule changes.  The process of submitting files will be described in a subsequent notebook."
